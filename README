Description:
libXCam is a project for extended camera features, especially 3A process.
It separates 3A algorithm and ISP image processor, and makes user defined
algorithm possible. This framework is also trying to make GPU joining the
image process.

Features:
  * 3A common APIs for Auto whitebalance, auto exposure, noise reduction, color correction,
    edge enhancement, gamma correction and so on.
  * Capture features support memory type of mmap and dma buffer.
  * 3A algorithm with AIQ binary(provided by Intel Corporation).
  * image processing based on Atom isp.
  * A simple 3A algorithm to guide users how to write specific algorithm.

Plans
  * Implement a gstreamer wrapper under Linux.
  * Implement auto focus based on AIQ.
  * Support dynamically load a 3rd party 3A algorithm.
  * Add OpenCL/vaapi image processing to co-work with ISP.
